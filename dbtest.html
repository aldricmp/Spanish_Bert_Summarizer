The paper quoted Timothy Pierce, managing director of Owens Corning's Asia operations, as saying the investments are part of the company's threepronged strategy to increase its presence in the world's largest market.
"We take the opportunities in China as our company's largest business opportunities in the world. Owens Corning's business in China now is the fastestgrowing section of its global business," Pierce said.
The paper said Owens Corning will invest 35 mln yuan setting up its fourth Chinabased fiberglass materials plant in the northern city of Tianjin.
It is expected to be operational in the third quarter with an annual production capacity of at least 24,000 tons.
"Our Tianjin project is mainly targetted at the potential customers of fiberglass materials in the construction of Beijing 2008 Olympic Games infrastructure projects," Pierce said.
Owens Corning will also invest 41 mln yuan in the construction of a facility in eastern China, which is likely to be operational in October, the paper said.
The company did not provide the location of the plant.
Owens Corning also plans to move its Asia headquarters to Shanghai from Hong Kong, where 20 pct of its China customers are based, the paper added.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Redacción</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[6]</td><td>2004-05-31 17:44:37.777000</td><td>2004-05-31 00:00:00</td><td>2004-06-01 00:00:00</td><td>2004-05-31 19:40:05</td><td>2004-05-31 19:40:05</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td></tr>
